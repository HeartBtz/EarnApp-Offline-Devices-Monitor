# Hello and welcome to Earnapp Offline Monitor

Here is a **scriptbot** to see in real time the status of your devices linked to **EarnApp**.  
The script runs every **15** minutes, but you will only receive an alert every **1.5** hours if your device is offline. If a new device appears in the offline list, a new **Discord** message will be sent.  
**This is a script, not a bot, so no program running in the background.**

a big thank you to **https://github.com/EvotecIT** for their PSDiscord module, and to **https://github.com/LockBlock-dev** for its API allowing to talk with Earnapp interface.


# Prerequisites  
Several libraries are needed here. This script is in Powershell. I also use javascript.  

 **1. Activate Powershell**  
 Powershell in Administrator mode => `set-executionpolicy unrestricted`  
 chose `yes for all` if necessary  
 
**2. Download PSDiscord Module**  
Powershell in Administrator mode => `Install-Module PSDiscord` & also  `Update-Module PSDiscord`  
chose `yes for all` if necessary  
Thanks to https://github.com/EvotecIT

 **3. Donwload NodeJS**  
 Install NodeJs using this link => https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.15.0/node-v16.15.0-x64.msi  

 **4. Install Earnapp.js Module**  
Open a `Command Prompt` window in Administrator mode  

   ```py
